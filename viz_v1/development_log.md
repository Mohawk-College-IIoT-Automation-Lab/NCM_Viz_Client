### To do
 - [ ] Make a base object `M_QWidget` that has all of the built-in stuff I want
    - [x] Logging
    - [x] Basic signals & slots
    - [ ] Clean exit
	    - [ ] Close connections
    - [x] Mqtt
    - [x] Status bar printing
- [ ] Adapt all the current widgets in `custom_qt_widgets.py` to be `MW_QWidget`'s
- [ ] Build a basic `M_QMqtt` object that has all of the basic functionality I want
	- [ ] replace the current class in `custom_qt_mqtt.py` with class that are defined within the class that they are used. They would extend the `M_QMqtt` base class.
- [ ] Create the NIDaqmx process that does the actual data capture
- [ ] Finish building the widgets for the tabs for a basic MVP
	- [ ] Needs to start/stop the data capture
	- [ ] Needs to store the raw data in a tdms file
	- [ ] Needs to plot the data in real-time on the app
	- [ ] Needs to be able to recall and plot the raw-data

## 04-22-2025
- Reorganized some code
- Planned out my next couple steps to building the first release

## 04-23-2025
- Working on `M_QObject`
	- Setting up the logger
	- Setting up basic Mqtt
- Re-implemented my original mqtt objects with `M_QObjects`
- Re-organizing the file structure such that all the objects for each widget are in the same file
- Re-working the sensor plots
- updated `M_QObject` to have a defined `log()` function and a `emit_and_log()` function
- Made the graphs expand the fill the screen
- Fixed all of the multiple inheritance mess
- Adjusted the way that the status bar is handled, now it's passed as an object rather than as a signal. Less to remember
- Working on the tool bar for experiment control
- Working on developing out `M_ActionSignleton`

## 04-24-2025
- trying to setup the venv / dependencies better than before
	- using an install script and `requirements.txt` document
	- Finished building a nice install script
	- Also made an uninstaller
- Had to remove the singletonness of the actions for the time being
- It now compiles and runs on multiple desktop envs. I should also make an equivalent install script for Windows.
	- I'll get buddy gpt to do convert it later.
- I want to spend some time today and work on the ni-daqmx side of things

## 04-28-2025
- Created a logger singleton, rather than extending it. Now I am going to decouple the logger and make each object create a copy of the singleton.
- Creating a single for each Mqtt Client type 
	- Sensor data (done and needs to be tested)
	- Status lights (done and needs to be tested)
	- Experiment Control
	- Mould Control
- Working on decoupling mqtt from qt
- Made a logger and generic mqtt sub module
	- Created a non-singleton logger as well.
- Added elapsed time and experiment status lights to the alarms. Also made them have a min size
- Next is the experiment control actions I think
- Made the logger setable, and if it's not set it will default to logging in log.log
- It is 1500 right now and everything is currently compiling, next steps I think should be:
	1. Experiment control actions & mqtt
	2. Receiving mqtt commands in the daq process and doing something
	3. Making the graphs work and the experiment status stuff respond
	4. Making sure the data is logging correctly in the tdms
	5. Double checking general logging is working
- Refactoring further.
- Taking a break at 1530 until 1600
- refactoring further.
- Really getting into the weeds of the daq process, making it very configurable and a singleton, really hope it works so I don't have to redo it.
- Currently 1700, stopping for a snack, then back to it.


## 04-29-2025
- Goal: Make the DAQ process work!
- DAQ object has:
	- Load from config
	- Call backs
- Everything compiles right now and throws minimal errors, but all of the structure is there, it should work. It's time to test
- I noticed a weird behaviour in testing. Basically what is happening is that I init everything with a Log called "DAQ.log", but what is happening is that after the process is created (and likely after pickeling) it's overwriting it to default and creating a new log called "log.log" the default name
	- Fixed it, I wasn't correctly setting the log name
- I have a new weird behaviour now, it's creating a duplicate process.
	- So it's connecting and everything works, but there are 2. I may need to make the process a singleton
	- I figured it out with some help from buddy gpt.
- Current state, the process is a starts, stops safely, is a singleton
	- need to test full functionality
	- connect it to the gui
- adjusted main.py to start the daq process correctly and kill it correclty
- it's getting very close, tomorrow I should be able to complete everything and then start doing some testing.

### To-do - tomorrow:
- [ ] Full functionality test, either with mosquitto_pub/sub or the app
- [ ] Connect the data sources to each other
- [ ] Finish implementing all the graphs
- [ ] Let it run for a while
- [ ] Make a seperate file for SensorData & other base models
- [ ] Clean up and improve
- [ ] Figure out how to do make a start-up window that allows you to configure the DAQ and then start it.
- [ ] Start to look into the SEN stuff

## 04-30-2025
- Integrated David's logger into the `GenericMQTTeLogger` repo
- Working on adapting the rest of the code
	- Should be done, need to test
	- Found an issue with David's logger where:
		- Defualt level was set too high
		- Multiple set of handlers were being created and causing problems like duplicate messages
- Added safe start up and close down using multiprocessing.Event
- Logging is working and everything starts!
- Made a logger and daq config and moved the base models
- turning all the mqtt stuff into singletons and adapting the configs
	- Actions
	- SensorsMQTT
	- StatusLightsMQTT
- Switching to absolute import and running with `python -m main.py`
- Fixed many bugs
- Adapted more or less everything to some sort of config file
- Everything starts up nicely, and seems to be working. Need to finish implementing actions so I can do full func testing.
- I setup the menu bar and it's working now, and fills the entire screen.

## 05-01-2025
- Setting up a config for the topic names for the different sections. 
- Chaning the static configs to be properly static for now. In the future we may want these to be configurable, but for now they will be static.
	- updated StatusLightsMqtt and QT_NCM_Status_Lights
	- upadted SensorsMqtt and QT_NCM_Sensrs
	- updated DAQ
- Testing everything
- Removed the exit action
- Fixing some things, I noticed that data is being published but nothing was being subbed to
	- I asked buddygpt and it suggested that I put the sub call backs in an on_connect
	- buddy is also suggesting I sub the add callbacks
- Callbacks are working now, now I need to fix the DAQ.
	- However things are looking good, it made a tdms file!!!
- Double checking that my broker is setup correctly, because I'm eeing some weirdness
	- In file `/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf` added:
	```
	listener 1883
	bind_address 0.0.0.0
	allow_anonymous true
	```
	- allowing on firewall `sudo ufw allow 1883/tcp`
- buddy gpt pointed out an issue with having multiple clients on one machine, they need to have names
- so it's publishing but it's not receiving. Also the daq seems to be kinda responding. 
	- Taking a break to head home will continue from there.
- setup the mqtt broker on wsl, and it's working so far.
	- I'm still trying to debug why messages don't seem to be coming in
	- I'm curious if there is an outbound firewall issue or something like that
	- The bug I'm playing with rn is caused by MQTTv5
	- Also I was hanging the program by accident with `.loop_forever()`
- omg it worked kinda, the exp start and stop toggled the gui
- Okay so I tested the alarms and they work correctly, we just send a 1 or 0 to the corresponding topic and they go
- Logging is working now! 
- Time to turn the GUI back on and make the graphs work
- Everything works but the graphs! 
- The graphs work, but now I'm getting some weird mqtt behaviours
	- I just needed to kill & restart the broker
- I need to properly set the scale for the graphs cuz it makes the data look like crap
- Need to scale the data after it's being
	- doing the scaling manually with numpy
- Setting the chart ranges, they're done
- I should add a lengend but I'll do it later
	- legend isn't working so I'm colour coding, will include the colouring in the help pop up
- It's as done as it needs to be for tomorrow.
- Pushing and putting it to bed for the evening

# 05-21-2025
- Did a site visit yesterday to UofT, the filtering in labview sucked, but also so did mine
- Working on adding median filter
- Fixing how the channels are setups and correctly setting the scales for the sensors 
- It runs right now but there are still spikes
- Noticed that all of the channels are reporting the same values, so there are potentially 2 problems:
    1. That the avg isn't working and is only operating on one columns and then using the same data for the others 
    2. That the median filtering is doing something similar
    - The fix is to explicity do it on each filter.
- I also noticed that the data is doing a weird pattern, I'm not sure if that's me averaging out the spikes or if there is something going on at the GLB, however those values should be very steady, and they were in the labview so something is up. However, they are also fucked now in the labview, so it could be the filtering and something that David changed in the labview that is making them weird. It is also entirely possible that Ian was doing things to make it not weird.

# 05-23-2025
- Currently on the train and a bunch of the changes I made the other day are lost, so time to do them all again.
- manually calculating each individual avg and median filter, I'm not 100% certain that the ranges were working correctly.
- I need to talk to Dong Hui about the sensors, I believe that the datasheet tells us that the reso is 1mm regardless of the range, and we have $2^16$ resolution, so we can measure 0.0001v when all we need to measure is $\frac{10}{800} = 0.0125 \frac{V}{mm}$
- Threw an error because I removed `units=VoltageUnits.FROM_CUSTOM_UNITS` from the channel init. It's weird that it does that even though it knows that I'm using a custom scale.
    - Regardless I set it back
- Kernel needs to be odd for median filter set it from `20` to `21`
- The inputs into the DAQ were wrong, but the sensors seem to be responding all correctly or atleast similar to the labview now.
    - The anemometers are still behving weird
    - The scaling is still wrong as well.
- The values were still reporting for the wrong sensors, so I fixed it more thuroughly. Also had to make the sure the averages were going to the right place.
- Changed the scales on the graphs to be set correctly. I need to grab this stuff from MQTT, eventually.
- Sidebar - I noticed neovim was acting weird, it's not highlighting my the NCM_Viz stuff
- Added the ranges for the sensors to the DAQconfig, and set the graphs and DAQ to have the same ranges using that constant.
- Based on the verbosity of the python I'm using for the DAQ, it may make more sense to write the DAQ code in c, it'll perform way better and allow us to run things way faster. 
- Fixing the offset, of the sensors using a linear scale, I set the y_int to the measured offset.
- Fixed the label on the graph because it bothered Dong hui that it was wrong
- Everything is working right now and the values that it's reporting seem very correct.
    - I need to spend sometime tuning the filters on Wednesday. 
- Dong Hui would like it if we can do that offset automatically.

## 05-26-2025
- refactoring, removing unused imports and what note
- Asked Paul to remove the taught ranges on the sensors, we have more than enough resolution on the sensors to read it correctly.
- turned on the built-in LPF in the NI-9202 ai modules

## 05-27-2025
- Changed how the sample rate is set
    - Rather than multiplying the sampler ate by 2 we divide the filters by 2 
- Enabled the oboard LPF for each channel we are using
- Added the scaling constants to the config

## 05-30-2025
- Added offset for each sensor 
- Changed how the signals are processed
    - I know loops are bad, but I put a loop 
- I really want to do the math in C, I think it'll be much more performant
    - I know that numpy is just C, but scipy is not, and I want to run the DAQ FAST 
- Going to put each sensor in the jig and adjust them so they read the same values.
- Added rounding to the anm & usd
